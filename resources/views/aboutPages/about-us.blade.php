                                    Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands, human cases of rabies are reported from all over 
                                    the country. The cases occur throughout the year. About 96% of the mortality and 
                                    morbidity is associated with dog bites. Cats, wolf, jackal, mongoose and monkeys
